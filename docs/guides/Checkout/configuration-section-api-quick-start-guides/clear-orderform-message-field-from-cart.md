The orderForm is the main object processed by VTEX checkout, and one of the most important data structures in the architecture of every VTEX store. It stores a lot of contextual information about the order which is important to the processing of the order: order items, client's personal data, delivery address, freight information, among others.

This guide will describe how to remove all messages from the `messages` field of the orderForm, leaving it empty.

# Removing all messages from the orderForm message field

To remove all messages from the orderForm `messages` field of the shopping cart, you need to use the [Clear orderForm messages](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/clearorderformmessages) endpoint. The `orderFormId` information of the shopping cart must be sent through the URL request, as shown by the example below:

`https://{accountname}.{environment.com.br}/api/checkout/pub/orderForm/ede846222cd44046ba6c638442c3505a/messages/clear`

Additionally, you need to send the request body containing only two curly brackets, as shown below:

```json
{}
```

After sending the request, the endpoint will return the response body containing the shopping cart information and the `messages` field empty, as shown in the example below:

```json

"messages": [],

```

>ℹ️ For more information about the meaning of each of the fields available in the shopping cart, access the [orderForm](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/orderform-fields) overview.

## Error codes

The following errors may appear as a message in the response body.

### 400 - Bad Request

- **Message error example (code 001)**: `"Bad Request"`. This message indicates that information other than `{}` was sent in the request body.

```json

    "fields": {},
    "error": {
        "code": "001",
        "message": "Bad request",

    },
    "operationId": "91b68251-1a60-4716-b846-c7c9c31fa565"
}
```

- **Message error example (code ORD002)**: `"Carrinho inválido"` (*Invalid Cart*). This message indicates that the `orderFormId` used in the request does not exist or is incorrect.

```json

    "fields": {},
    "error": {
        "code": "ORD002",
        "message": "Carrinho inválido",
        "exception": null
    },
    "operationId": "5d37a185-bfe6-4686-9d92-aac9482cc63d"
}
```

### 404 - Not Found

- **Message error example**: `"The requested URL was not found on the server"`: check that the URL data is correct.

```json
<body>
	<h1>404 Not Found</h1>
	<p>The requested URL was not found on this server.</p>
</body>
```
